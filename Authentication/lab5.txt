Lab: Username enumeration via response timing
Note: Vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times.

Soln:
(1) Use incorrect usename and password.
(2) Use correct username and incorrect password.
(3) Use intruder and brute force for correct uesername.(Response with high response time)
(4) Use header "X-Forwarded-For: number(1,2,3,...)"
(5) X-Forwarded-For -> de-facto standard header for identifying the          originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.
    X-Forwarded-For: <client>, <proxy>
    X-Forwarded-For: <client>, <proxy>, â€¦, <proxyN>
(6) See maximum response time in responses -> Brute force the password for identified username.
